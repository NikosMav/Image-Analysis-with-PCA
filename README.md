## Introduction

This machine learning homework focuses on the following tasks:

1. **Image Preprocessing and Visualization**: Load a set of images, resize them to a common dimension, reshape them into 1D arrays, and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction. Visualize the images in a 2D space.

2. **Explanation of PCA Results**: Provide an explanation of the PCA results and the significance of image positions in the 2D space.

3. **Classification Using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Perform image classification using the k-NN algorithm in both the original image space and the reduced PCA space. Evaluate the classification accuracy using 5-fold cross-validation.

4. **Optimal Number of Principal Components for PCA**: Experiment with different numbers of principal components in PCA and identify the optimal number that yields the best results.

5. **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Implement NMF with regularization on a synthetic dataset. Explore different parameter settings and track the number of iterations required for convergence.
